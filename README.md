# Single_Cell_Pipeline
This project provides a complete pipeline for single-cell RNA-seq preprocessing and visualization, enabling researchers to interactively explore quality control metrics, dimensionality reductions (UMAP, t-SNE, TriMap, Diffusion Map, PHATE), gene expression, and clustering results in an intuitive dashboard.
